# DMoney_Transaction_API_Automation by Postman & Newman

## About this Project
### In this project I have automated the d-money transaction api using postman and newman. D-money is a demo financial related project to test the transaction api where fake transaction and money can be transferred. Here I have covered the following tasks as admin creates an agent and random 2 customers, deposit some money from SYSTEM account to the agent, agent deposit to any of 1 customer, check agent balance, then withdraw any amount by the customer from the agent, the customer checks balance, send money to the other customer, then from the another customer payment to a specific merchant, the second customer will check both balance and statement and then the merchant will check his own balance.
